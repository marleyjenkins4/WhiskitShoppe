# Whisk It Shoppe App and Website
The Whisk It Shoppe is a small business based out of Rock Hill, SC. It is the only brick and mortar bakery in the Rock Hill area. It has cakes, cookies, and all the pastries you can think of. The only thing it doesn't have is a website.

That's where the DIFD 451 class comes in. 

DIFD 451 is the capstone class where all four disciplines come together with their respective skills to help small businesses in need. Part of that involves making a website for the business. For the Whisk It Shoppe website users will be able to: 
* view the menu
* see shop hours and location
* login
* place orders
